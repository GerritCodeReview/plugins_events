      "message": "I think that synchronizing here is hard to get right, and likely actually slower since the process is a serialized process anyway, and splitting it across threads can only add more overhead. Additionally, I suspect that adding a synchronized is anywhere is not going to work unless the synchronized object is shared across all threads, which current lock is not. The original EventBroker is declared with a Guice @Singleton, using that on this broker could likely help achieve this.",
